# Flask-in-7-Days

This repository is a personal project used to learn **Flask** in 7 days. It is divided into two main parts:

1. **learning-path**: This directory contains the resources and exercises that I used to learn Flask step-by-step.
2. **capstone-blog-project**: This directory contains the final **Capstone Blog Project**, which applies the knowledge gained from the learning path to build a practical Flask web application.
