# Flask in 7 Days

## Overview
This repository documents my journey of learning Flask in one week. My goal is to understand the fundamentals of Flask and build a beginner-friendly project to apply my knowledge.

## Learning Plan
I am following a structured 7-day learning plan:

1. **Introduction to Flask** - Setting up the environment, creating a basic app.
2. **Handling Requests & Responses** - Working with GET/POST, request data.
3. **Templates & Static Files** - Jinja2 templates, passing data, serving static files.
4. **Forms & Flask-WTF** - Handling forms, validation, and flash messages.
5. **Databases & SQLAlchemy** - CRUD operations, migrations, and database interactions.
6. **Authentication & Sessions** - User authentication, password hashing, and session management.
7. **Building & Deploying a Mini Project** - Structuring the project, integrating features, and deployment.

## Project: Flask Task Manager
As part of this journey, I will build a simple **Flask Task Manager** application that allows users to:

- Create, update, and delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Use authentication to manage personal tasks.
- Store tasks in a database using Flask-SQLAlchemy.
- Deploy the project online for accessibility.

## Repository Structure
This repository will be structured as follows:
```
/Flask-in-7-Days
│── /app               # Application code
│── /templates         # HTML templates
│── /static            # CSS, JavaScript, images
│── /migrations        # Database migrations
│── .gitignore         # Git ignore file
│── README.md          # Project documentation
│── requirements.txt   # Dependencies
│── app.py             # Main Flask application
│── config.py          # Configuration settings
```

## Progress Tracking
I will push my daily progress to this repository. Each day, I will create commits reflecting new concepts learned and improvements to the Flask Task Manager project.

## Deployment Plan
At the end of the week, I will deploy the Flask Task Manager on a free hosting service like **Render** or **Railway.app**.
